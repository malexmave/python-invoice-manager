Planned features

This file is, at the moment, more of a reminder to myself about the features I
want to implement. Inclusion in this file does not mean that a feature will
actually happen, it only means that I am looking into it.

Possible features:
* Hooks
* Plugin-Infrastructure
* curses-GUI (instead of only text-based)
* GTK-GUI (in addition to curses / text-based, for later versions)

Possible plugins:
* Deutsche Post Internetmarke (automatically purchase a postage stamp and 
  integrate it into the output file)
  * This is somewhat unlikely at the moment, as their API is very badly
    documented.
